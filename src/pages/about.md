Hello, I’m Ariz.

I’m a proud father to a wonderful daughter and husband to a happy wife. Coffee is my passion—whether it’s buying a fresh roast or manually brewing, I especially love using the V60 dripper. Professionally, I lead a talented engineering team and work as a developer for a Japanese-based company focused on digitalizing their workspace.

One of my proudest achievements is developing a custom controller powered by ESP32, which has been successfully adopted by partner companies. Over the past two years, I’ve embraced the challenge of being a solo warrior in my company, managing everything from development and infrastructure to security and project management. This journey has broadened my perspective and helped me grow both professionally and personally.

Problem-solving is at the core of who I am—sometimes my curiosity even leads to a little burnout, but I always come back eager to tackle the next challenge. When I’m not working, you’ll find me immersed in music, still loyal to Winamp and its incredible DSP features. I highly recommend trying out Jammix Enhancer if you’re a music enthusiast like me.

This blog is my space to share my thoughts, projects, adventures, and everything in between. Thanks for stopping by and reading through!
